# Python → Rust Parity Execution Update (2026-02-11)

## Completed in this execution slice

### 1) `monolith-cli export` moved from stub to functional path
- Implemented checkpoint resolution from either:
  - explicit checkpoint file, or
  - checkpoint directory (auto-picks latest `checkpoint-*.json`).
- Added real model restore + export flow via `monolith-checkpoint::ModelExporter`.
- Added optional quantization pass (8-bit / 16-bit simulation) and validation.
- Added optional warmup asset copy flow into export output.
- Added explicit `--model-version` support.
- Added explicit error behavior for unsupported `onnx` / `torchscript` formats.

### 2) `monolith-cli serve` lifecycle parity improved
- Replaced stub behavior with real startup/shutdown of `monolith_serving::Server`.
- Command now:
  - builds serving config from CLI flags,
  - starts the primary serving server,
  - blocks until ctrl-c,
  - performs graceful stop.

### 3) CLI test parity hardening
- Fixed `tf_runner` tests to use valid dotted task names matching model registry resolution semantics.
- Added/updated export tests covering:
  - file checkpoint export path,
  - latest checkpoint selection from directory,
  - unsupported format errors,
  - invalid quantization bit-width errors.

### 4) Linux workspace build/test lane hardening
- Updated `monolith-examples` default features to avoid Apple-only Metal dependency on Linux.
- Fixed rank-2 tensor concatenation bug in `monolith-layers::Tensor::cat`:
  - dim=0 now validates columns and sums rows,
  - dim=1 now validates rows and sums columns.
- Added regression tests for rank-2 concat on both dimensions.
- Removed strict DIEN hidden-size panic in stock example model constructor to keep forward path shape-safe.

## Validation evidence (commands run)

1. `cargo test -p monolith-cli -q` ✅  
2. `cargo test -p monolith-layers -q` ✅  
3. `cargo test -p monolith-examples --bin stock_prediction test_model_forward -q` ✅  
4. `cargo test --workspace -q` ✅

## Notes
- This update specifically closes major TODO/stub surfaces in CLI runtime flows and restores a reliable Linux workspace test command.
- Remaining parity workstreams continue in core/native-training/domain-specific modules listed in task definitions.
